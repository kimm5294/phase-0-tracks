# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method used to keep track of changes made to files and allows one to rewind back to older versions like a time machine. It is useful because it lets you revert back to older versions of a file in case something in a more recent update causes issues. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is like a different version of a file. It creates alternate versions of the same file so multiple people can work on it at the same time without getting in each other's ways. Also by using different branches it is easier to keep your main file organized. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point and each time you commit something you make a save point that you can revert back to later. Also you can make notes on each commit point to take note of what exact changes you made in that save. A good commit message tells you what was changed in the file. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can occur when you are merging branches together. A merge conflict is when a file that is being merged from different branches has lines of code or files in those branches that oppose each other. This can occur if the same lines of code are changed in both branches but they are changed in different ways.
