#Plan to tackle jQuery
*First, research exactly what you can do with jquery 
*Second use google to learn how to use jquery and where to type jquery code in order to have it impact an html file
*Third, research and learn syntax for different things you can do in jquery (spend majority of time here)
*Notes- use google to find new resources and shorter articles that are more concise. Use w3schools for more in depth detail and for practice stuff. Browse through codecademy if you're desperate or have extra time. 
*Take breaks from researching to actually try stuff out
*I plan on approaching this topic by just diving right in. Figure out what it does, how to use it, how to write jquery and do it. 

#Post Plan
*I found that using google was the most efficient for finding out quick things about jquery like what it does, where to write the code
*W3schools was a great resource for figuring out how to write stuff and practicing jquery as well as getting much more in depth details
*W3schools was my primary source of information and then codecademy was a secondary one I used
*Digital ocean also proved to be a useful resource because it had step by step guides on how to use jquery and examples


##Things I learned
*jQuery is a form of javascript that makes it easier to use
*jQuery files are javascript files that are linked to html files just like a normal stylesheet except preferably at the bottom
*You need to "activate" jquery by connecting to a cdn or downloading and connecting to a local jquery file
