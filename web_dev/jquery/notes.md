#Plan to tackle jQuery
*First, research exactly what you can do with jquery 
*Second use google to learn how to use jquery and where to type jquery code in order to have it impact an html file
*Third, research and learn syntax for different things you can do in jquery (spend majority of time here)
*Notes- use google to find new resources and shorter articles that are more concise. Use w3schools for more in depth detail and for practice stuff. Browse through codecademy if you're desperate or have extra time. 
*Take breaks from researching to actually try stuff out
*I plan on approaching this topic by just diving right in. Figure out what it does, how to use it, how to write jquery and do it.
