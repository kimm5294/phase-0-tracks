1. One of the key philosophies of Linux is that the user should not be limited in terms of what commands they can use in the operating system and command line. Users are assumed to know exactly what they are doing and given all the power of the operating system.  
    *Some other key components of the Linux philosophy include keeping things smaller such as smaller, cleaner programs. 
    *There is also the idea that each program should only do one thing as long as it does it well.
