2. A GET request is one that is requesting information/data from a source like a server. A POST request is one that is sending data to a server. GET requests should be used to retrieve data and are usually not as safe because they can be cached and bookmarked. A POST request is not able to be saved in the bookmarks, history or cached so it is usually safer. 

3. A cookie is data that a server sends to your web browser when you access a website. The web browser saves the cookie so that when you enter the website again, you send the cookie with you request and the server can know if you've visited the site before. This allows the website to remember some data from your last visit, like whether it will leave you logged in, what settings you had, etc.
