2. A GET request is one that is requesting information/data from a source like a server. A POST request is one that is sending data to a server. GET requests should be used to retrieve data and are usually not as safe because they can be cached and bookmarked. A POST request is not able to be saved in the bookmarks, history or cached so it is usually safer.
